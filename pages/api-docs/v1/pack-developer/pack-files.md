This path in the API provides ways to see and edit information about your packs files. Please note that the pack name
provided in these calls must have all non alphanumeric characters removed and case is sensitive.

## GET /admin/pack/[pack name]/files/[folder name]

This returns an array of [Admin Pack File Object](/api-docs/v1/_objects/admin/pack-file) containing information about
all the files in the given folders name. If no folder name is given, you will get the files for the root (/) path of
your packs files. If you call '/admin/pack/[pack name]/files/test/folder/' for example, you'll get all the files in
that (/test/folder/) path.

Files are sorted in alphabetical order.

the API will return an error.

## PUT /admin/pack/[pack name]/file/[folder name]/[file name]

If the file is uploaded then it will return a [Admin Pack File Object](/api-docs/v1/_objects/admin/pack-file) for the
file.

## DELETE /admin/pack/[pack name]/file/[folder name]/[file name]
