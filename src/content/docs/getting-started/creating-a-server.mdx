Servers allow you to play Minecraft with others in multiplayer mode. Servers are run separately from instances and you
must also [create an instance](/getting-started/create-an-instance) in order to join any servers that you or others
create.

## Create a Vanilla Server

You can create a Vanilla server by going to the Create Pack tab and selecting the version of Minecraft you want to use,
as well as giving it a name and description:

![Select a Modloader](@assets/getting-started/creating-a-server/create-vanilla-server.png)

You can optionally choose a modloader to use if you plan to install mods to the instance. Once you select the modloader,
you can then select the version of the modloader you want to use:

![Select a Modloader](@assets/getting-started/select-modloader.png)

Then you can click the "Create Server" button to start the install process and create the server. Once created it will
be listed in the Servers tab.

## Create a Server From A Premade Modpack

If you want to create a server from a premade modpack, such as one from ATLauncher, CurseForge or Modrinth, you can do
so by going to the Packs tab. You can search for a specific pack if you know the name, else you can browse the different
platforms by using the tabs on the left side of the screen.

Alternatively if you don't know what modpack you want to create a server from, a list of all the popular packs will be
shown by default when you visit the Packs tab.

<Aside type="caution" title="Not all modpacks support creating servers">
Not all modpacks support creating servers. Some modpacks may not have a "Create Server" button. In these cases you will
need to contact the modpack creator or visit the website for the modpack to see if they have a separate download for the
server files.

ATLauncher staff will not be able to help you with this, as we do not control how modpacks choose to distribute and
support servers for their modpacks.
</Aside>

Once you've found the pack you want to create a server for, you can click the "Create Server" button to create the
server:

Then you can select a name for your server as well as picking a specific version of the Modpack to create the server
from:

![Create Server From A Premade Modpack Name](@assets/getting-started/creating-a-server/create-server-from-a-premade-modpack-name.png)

You can then click the "Install" button to start the install process and create the server. Once created it will be
listed in the Servers tab.
