Once you have [created a server](/getting-started/creating-a-server) you can start it through the launcher or you can
start it manually.

## Starting Through The Launcher

To start the server, just click the "Launch" button on the server in the Servers tab.

You can also choose to "Launch & Close" to close the launcher after the server has started. You can also choose to
launch with the Minecraft server GUI by clicking the "Launch With GUI" button:

![Launch Buttons](@assets/getting-started/starting-a-server/launch-buttons.png)

Once you click one of the buttons, a separate window will open (usually called Terminal, cmd or PowerShell) where you
can see the output of the server starting. Any errors and logs will be shown here, and not in the launcher.

The first time you start a server you likely will need to accept the EULA. This will be shown in the logs. See below for
how to accept the EULA.

If you're having issues starting the server, try starting it manually as described below. If that doesn't work, you will
need to contact the modpack creator for support with how to start the server.

ATLauncher staff will not be able to help you with this.

## Starting Manually

If the server is not launching through the launcher, you can start it manually by clicking the "Open Folder" button on
the server in the Servers tab:

![Open Folder Button](@assets/common/server-open-folder-button.png)

This will open the server folder in your file explorer. From here you can look for a way to start the server.

Usually this is a file called `LaunchServer`, `run`, `ServerStart`, `start` or `StartServer`.

The first time you start a server you likely will need to accept the EULA. This will be shown in the logs. See below for
how to accept the EULA.

If you cannot find a script to run, or running it manually doesn't work, you will need to contact the modpack creator
for support with how to start the server.

## Accepting The EULA

If you're starting a server for the first time, you will need to accept the EULA. To do this you will need to find the
`eula.txt` file in the server folder. You first need to open the servers folder in your file explorer:

![Open Folder Button](@assets/common/server-open-folder-button.png)

Then look for the `eula.txt` file.

Read the file and make sure you understand what it says. If you do, then you can accept the EULA by changing the false
in the file to true:
