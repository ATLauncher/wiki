This page will help you download mods, resource packs, shaders and more to your instances.

First you're going to need to [create an instance](/getting-started/creating-an-instance) with a modloader installed.

Then you can download mods from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) through
the launcher.

You can get started downloading mods by clicking the "Add Mods" button on the instance:

![Add Mods To An Instance](@assets/getting-started/downloading-content/add-mods-to-an-instance.png)

This will bring up a screen where you can search for mods, resource packs, shaders and more.

## Switching Between Content Types

You can switch between different types of content using the dropdown menu in the top left of the Add Mods screen. This allows you to easily browse and download:

- Mods
- Plugins
- Resource Packs
- Shader Packs
- Worlds

The different types of content you can add to your instance will depend on which modloader you have installed when creating the instance.

## Searching

You can search by using the search bar at the top right of the Add Mods screen:

![Search](@assets/getting-started/downloading-content/search-for-mods.png)

Please note that the search for CurseForge may not return accurate results. If you're having issues, please use more specific search terms and don't use common words such as "the" or "and".

Alternatively please try changing to Modrinth as it may return more accurate results.

## Switching Between CurseForge and Modrinth

If you want to switch between CurseForge and Modrinth, you can do so by using the dropdown in the top left of the Add Mods screen.

![Switching Between CurseForge and Modrinth](@assets/getting-started/downloading-content/switch-between-curseforge-and-modrinth.png)

If you wish to change the default platform which is used, you can change this in the Mods settings of the launcher.

## Changing Category

You can change the category of mods you want to download by using the dropdown up the top of the Add Mods screen:

![Changing Category](@assets/getting-started/downloading-content/change-category.png)

**NOTE:** CurseForge and Modrinth have different categories, so some categories may not be available on both sites and may also be named differently.
