This page will help you download mods, resource packs, shaders and more to your instances.

First you're going to need to [create an instance](/getting-started/creating-an-instance) with a modloader installed.
Then you can download mods from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) through
the launcher.

You can get started downloading mods by clicking the "Add Mods" button on the instance:

## Switching Between CurseForge and Modrinth

If you want to switch between CurseForge and Modrinth, you can do so by using the dropdown in the top left of the Add
Mods screen.

This allows you to switch between searching for mods on CurseForge and Modrinth.

## Changing Categories

You can change the categories of mods you want to download by using the dropdown up the top of the Add Mods screen.

**NOTE:** CurseForge and Modrinth have different categories, so some categories may not be available on both sites and
may also be named differently.a
