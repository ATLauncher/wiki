When you create a server, by default there is usually no JVM arguments set. If you want to set them up, it will depend
on how the server was created.

## For CurseForge Modpacks

In order to change the JVM arguments for CurseForge modpacks, you will need to contact the modpack creator for support
with how to change the JVM arguments for their server.

As CurseForge modpacks are uploaded by the modpack creator themselves, we have no way of knowing how to change the
JVM arguments for their servers.

You may try looking in the server folder for some sort of readme file or some other documentation that may help you,
but failing that, please contact the modpack creator for support.

## For Everything Else

You can change the JVM arguments by going to the Servers tab in the launcher and then clicking the "Open Folder"
button:

In the folder that opens, you can look for the `LaunchServer` script. In Windows you want the `LaunchServer.bat` file,
for Linux/OSX you want the `LaunchServer.sh` file.

### For Windows

Once you've found the `LaunchServer.bat` file (note that it may just be shown as `LaunchServer` if you have file
extensions turned off), you can open it in Notepad. You can also right click the file and click the `Edit in Notepad`
option if it shows:

In order to change the JVM arguments used when launching the server, look for the line near the top of the file that
says `set jvmargs=""`:

You can put anything in the middle of the double quotes and that will be used when starting the Minecraft server. For
instance to add a initial memory size of 1GB, it would look like below:

<Aside type="caution" title="Do Not Remove The Quotes">
Make sure to keep the quotes around the JVM arguments otherwise it may not work.
</Aside>

Save the file and then next time you start the server it will use the new JVM arguments.

### For Linux/OSX

Once you've found the `LaunchServer.sh` file you can open it in any text editor. Then look for the line near the top of
the file that says `JVMARGS=""`:

![Set JVM Arguments For Linux/Mac](@assets/guides/changing-servers-jvm-arguments/launchserver-linux-set-jvmargs.png)

You can put anything in the middle of the double quotes and that will be used when starting the Minecraft server. For
instance to add a initial memory size of 1GB, it would look like below:

### What To Do If The Above Doesn't Work?

<Aside type="caution" title="Where To Go For Help">
If you cannot figure out how to change the JVM arguments for a server, you will need to contact the modpack creator for
support with how to change the JVM arguments for the server.

ATLauncher staff will not be able to help you with this as many servers have different ways that they manage their
servers and how to change the JVM arguments.
