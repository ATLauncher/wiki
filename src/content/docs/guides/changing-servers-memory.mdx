When you create a server, the amount of memory that the server uses is usually set by default to 2GB. In order to change
this, it depends on how the server was created.

## For CurseForge Modpacks

In order to change the memory allocation for CurseForge modpacks, you will need to contact the modpack creator for
support with how to change the memory allocation for their server.

As CurseForge modpacks are uploaded by the modpack creator themselves, we have no way of knowing how to change the
memory allocation for their servers.

You may try looking in the server folder for some sort of readme file or some other documentation that may help you,
but failing that, please contact the modpack creator for support.

## For Everything Else

You can change the memory allocation by going to the Servers tab in the launcher and then clicking the "Open Folder"
button:

In the folder that opens, you can look for the `LaunchServer` script. In Windows you want the `LaunchServer.bat` file,
for Linux/OSX you want the `LaunchServer.sh` file.

### For Windows

Once you've found the `LaunchServer.bat` file (note that it may just be shown as `LaunchServer` if you have file
extensions turned off), you can open it in Notepad. You can also right click the file and click the `Edit in Notepad`
option if it shows:

In order to change the memory allocated to the server, look for the line near the top of the file that says
`set maxmemory=2G`:

![Set Max Memory For Windows](@assets/guides/changing-servers-memory/launchserver-set-maxmemory.png)

You can change the `2G` value that is there by default to whatever you want. For example, if you wanted to change the
memory to 8GB, you would change it to `8G`:

![Set Max Memory To 8GB For Windows](@assets/guides/changing-servers-memory/launchserver-set-maxmemory-8g.png)

<Aside type="caution" title="Do Not Use MB or GB">
Make sure when changing this value that you do not use MB or GB, as this will not work. You must use G for Gigabytes
and M for Megabytes.
</Aside>

Save the file and then next time you start the server it will use the new memory allocation.

### For Linux/OSX

Once you've found the `LaunchServer.sh` file you can open it in any text editor. Then look for the line near the top of
the file that says `MEMORY="2G"`:

![Set Max Memory For Linux/Mac](@assets/guides/changing-servers-memory/launchserver-linux-set-memory.png)

You can change the `2G` value that is there by default to whatever you want. For example, if you wanted to change the
memory to 8GB, you would change it to `8G`:

![Set Max Memory To 8GB Linux/Mac](@assets/guides/changing-servers-memory/launchserver-linux-set-memory-8g.png)
