## Importing An Instance From A File

If you have exported an instance from another launcher, you can import it into ATLauncher by going to the Instances
tab in the launcher and then clicking the "Import" button:

You can then select the exported file and click the "Import" button:

![Import Instance File](@assets/guides/importing-an-instance/import-instance-file.png)

Once imported, you can then choose the name for the instance and then click the "Install" button:

![Import Instance Name](@assets/guides/importing-an-instance/import-instance-name.png)

This will install the instance and you can now play Minecraft.

## Importing An Instance From A Url

You can also import an instance from a url instead of a file. This is useful if the instance is hosted on a website
already so that you don't have to download it yourself.

You can follow the same steps as above, but instead of selecting a file, you can select a url:
