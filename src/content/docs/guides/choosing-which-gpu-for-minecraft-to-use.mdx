If you have multiple GPUs in your system (which is common for gaming laptops), you may want to choose which GPU to use
for Minecraft.

A lot of time, the default will be to use the less powerful GPU that's built into your CPU for power saving reasons.

You likely will want to change that so that it uses your dedicated GPU for more performance.

## Changing For Windows 10/11

To set the GPU that's used for Windows 10/11, you can use the Graphics settings application which you can find in the
start menu:

Then you can click the "Browse" button:

![Windows 10 Graphics Settings Browse](@assets/guides/choosing-which-gpu-for-minecraft-to-use/windows-10-browse-app.png)

You then need to browse to the folder that you installed ATLauncher.

To find the folder that ATLauncher is installed in, you can click "Open Folder" in the launchers bottom left corner:

</details>

Then you need to go into the `runtimes` folder and then into the `minecraft` folder. Within this folder you'll see one
or more folders for each of the runtimes that Minecraft uses. You must add each of these folders by going into the
folder and finding the `bin` folder which will have a `javaw.exe` file in it.

See the below gif for an example of finding one of these runtimes:

<Aside type="caution" title="You Must Add javaw.exe Not java.exe">
The launcher uses the `javaw.exe` binary to launch Minecraft not the `java.exe` binary. Make sure to add the `javaw.exe`
file otherwise it will not work to select the right GPU.

Then you can click `Options` button on the item that was just added and then choose `High performance` and then click
'Save':

![Then set it to High performance](@assets/guides/choosing-which-gpu-for-minecraft-to-use/windows-10-set-high-performance.png)

You'll need to do this for all the runtimes that are in the launchers folder, also keeping in mind that newer Minecraft
versions may use new runtimes which will also need to be added.

## Changing In NVIDIA Control Panel

If you use a NVIDIA GPU, you can change the GPU that's used by going to the `NVIDIA Control Panel` and then going to
`Manage 3D Settings` and then you can choose to change the preferred graphics processor at a global level or by going to
the `Program Settings` tab and clicking `Add`.

You then need to browse to the folder that you installed ATLauncher.

Once added you can then select the preferred graphics processor.
